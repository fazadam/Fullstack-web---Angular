                            <p>The Elves, were the first and eldest of the Children of IlÃºvatar, considered the fairest
                                and
                                wisest of the earthly race of Arda. They called themselves the Quendi (Quenya; IPA:
                                [ËkÊ·endi]; "the Speakers"; singular QuendÃ« [ËkÊ·ende]), referring to how at their
                                creation,
                                they were the only living things they knew of who spoke.[4]

                                OromÃ« referred to the Elves that chose to follow him during the Great Journey as Eldar
                                (Q.:
                                "People of the Stars"), because when they awake the stars were the only lights in the
                                sky.
                                Some, known afterwards as the Calaquendi (Elves of the Light), were brought by the Valar
                                from Middle-earth to Valinor across the Sea, where they were taught by the Ainur. But
                                after
                                the Silmarils were stolen by Melkor, some of the Elves returned to Middle-earth, where
                                they
                                remained until the end of the Third Age.[5]

                                Elves were immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime. They
                                could
                                be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.</p>

                                was
                                unwilling to await the coming of the Children of IlÃºvatar, for he was impatient and

                            <p>In the Undying Lands around TA 1000, ManwÃ« (leader of the Ainur, and King of the Valar
                                and
                                Arda) learned that the dark lord Morgoth's most loyal lieutenant, Sauron, was returning
                                to
                                power. He then summoned a council which concluded that the Valar were to send three
                                messengers to Middle-Earth to protect the free peoples and reassure them that the Valar
                                had
                                not forgotten them. Only two Maiar came: Curumo (later named Saruman) sent by AulÃ«, and
                                Alatar (Morinehtar), sent by OromÃ«. ManwÃ« summoned OlÃ³rin (later named Gandalf), asking
                                if
                                he would go as the third messenger. OlÃ³rin claimed he was too weak and that he feared
                                Sauron. However, ManwÃ« said that was all the more reason to go, and he commanded him go,
                                whereupon Varda said, "Not as the third." Yavanna asked Curumo to take Aiwendil also
                                (later
                                named Radagast), and Alatar took his friend Pallando (RÃ³mestÃ¡mo) as his companion. They
                                were
                                expressly forbidden to dominate the free peoples of Middle-Earth or to match Sauron's
                                power
                                with power and if they deviated from their appointed task they would be cast out and

                                The five wizards, by Mairon66

                                The Wizards were known by various names and were arrayed in different colors. Of those
                                who
                                came to Middle-Earth, sent by the Valar, five are known, the Heren Istarion (Order of
                                Wizards). After arriving in Middle-earth, the two Blue Wizards apparently went east
                                before
                                the War of the Ring; whether they played a part in the events of that war is unknown.[1]
                                Radagast the Brown concerned himself mainly with plants and animals, living in Mirkwood
                                for
                                many years. Saruman the White, and Gandalf the Grey spent their time with the Free
                                Peoples:
                                the Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Saruman was wise and respected, later becoming the head of
                                the
                                White Council in TA 2463. However, he became prideful and jealous of the power and
                                purity of
                                Gandalf's spirit and reputation. Saruman slowly came to betray the original purpose of
                                the
                                Wizards and sought power for himself.</p>

                            <h2>Ents</h2>
                            <p>Evidence of the origin of the Ents can be found in the Valaquenta, in an exchange between
                                Yavanna (a queen of the Valar, "...lover of all things that grow in the earth.") and
                                ManwÃ«
                                ("...the first of all Kings: lord of the realm of Arda."), after Yavanna's spouse AulÃ«
                                secretly endeavors to create the Dwarves. AulÃ« reminds her that the children of IlÃºvatar
                                (Elves, Men and now Dwarves) will exploit her creations for their own benefit, "though
                                not
                                without respect and gratitude." The defenselessness of her realm moves Yavanna to plead
                                with
                                ManwÃ«: "My heart is anxious, thinking of the days to come. All my works are dear to
                                me...
                                Shall nothing that I have devised be free from the dominion of others?â ManwÃ« responds
                                by
                                asking, of all she holds dear, what she would have preserved against exploitation, and
                                she
                                answers: "...the Kelvar can flee or defend themselves, whereas the Olvar that grow
                                cannot.
                                And among these I hold trees dear... Would that the trees might speak on behalf of all
                                things that have roots, and punish those that wrong them!â ManwÃ«, while deliberating,
                                was
                                overcome by a vision of the Music of the Ainur, and granted her request: "Behold! When
                                the
                                Children awake, then the thought of Yavanna will awake also, and it will summon spirits
                                from
                                afar, and they will go among the kelvar and the olvar, and some will dwell therein, and
                                be
                                held in reverence, and their just anger shall be feared." Yavanna returns to her spouse
                                AulÃ«
                                and reports: "Eru is bountiful. Now let thy children beware! For there shall walk a
                                power in
                                the forests whose wrath they will arouse at their peril." He responds ominously:
                                "Nonetheless they will have need of wood."

                                Almost nothing is known of the early history of the Ents â they apparently lived in and
                                protected the large forests of Middle-earth in previous ages, and they briefly appeared
                                (in
                                tales) near the end of the First Age, attacking a band of Dwarves at the Battle of Sarn
                                Athrad, supposedly having been summoned by Beren and LÃºthien. Treebeard told of a time
                                when
                                all of Eriador was one huge forest and part of his domain, but these immense forests
                                were
                                cut by the NÃºmenÃ³reans of the Second Age, or destroyed in the calamitous War of the
                                Elves
                                and Sauron of the 17th century of the Second Age. Treebeard's statement is also
                                supported by
                                remarks that Elrond made at the Council of Elrond. Elrond said that "Time was once when
                                a
                                squirrel could carry a nut from tree to tree from Rivendell to the Great Sea...",
                                further
                                indicating that all of Eriador was once a single vast primeval forest, of which Fangorn
                                Forest was just "the eastern end of it" according to Treebeard.

                                Treebeard boasted to Merry and Pippin about the strength of the Ents. He said that they
                                were
                                much more powerful than Trolls, which Morgoth (in the Elder Days or First Age)
                                supposedly
                                made as imitations of the Ents, but did not come near to their power. He compares this
                                with
                                how Orcs were Morgoth's imitation of Elves. There used to be Entwives (literally
                                "ent-women"), but they started to move farther away from the Ents because they liked to
                                plant and control things, so they moved away to the region that would later become the
                                Brown
                                Lands across the Great River Anduin. This area was destroyed by Sauron, and the Entwives
                                disappeared. The Ents looked for them, but have never found them. It is sung by the Ents
                                that one day they will find each other, when they lose all else. In The Fellowship of
                                the
                                Ring, Sam Gamgee says his cousin Hal saw a walking tree in the north of the Shire. When
                                Pippin and Merry tell Treebeard about the Shire, Treebeard says the Entwives would like
                                that
                                land, suggesting Hal saw either an Entwife or a Huorn. It is safe to say that with no
                                Entwives and their slow decline with time, numbers of the Ents had dwindled by the end
                                of
                                the Third Age. According to Treebeard there are no Entings upon Middle-earth at the time
                                of
                                the Third Age, and there have not been any for quite some time. And there will never be
                                any
                                more Entings afterwards either, "as there are no Entwives". What exactly happened to the
                                Entwives was something J.R.R. Tolkien wanted to keep a mystery, even to himself, but in
                                one
                                of his letters he said, "I think that in fact the Entwives have disappeared for good,
                                being
                                destroyed with their gardens in the War of the Last Alliance."[citation needed]</p>

                            <h2>Orcs</h2>
                            <p>Orcs were the primary soldiers of the Dark Lords' armies and the most common of their
                                servants. They were conceived of by Morgoth during the Years of the Lamps, serving him
                                and
                                later his successor, Sauron, in their quest to dominate Middle-earth. Before OromÃ« first
                                found the Elves at CuiviÃ©nen, Melkor kidnapped some of them and cruelly deformed them,
                                twisting them into the first Orcs.[1]

                                After the War for Sake of the Elves many Orcs (along with fallen Maiar and other evil
                                servants of Melkor) survived in the deep caves, pits, chambers, and tunnels of Melkor's
                                underground fortress Angband. They multiplied and later spread through northern
                                Middle-earth. They were first seen by the Dwarves who reported them to Thingol, King of
                                Doriath, causing the latter to seek weapons of war for the first time.[2] For over a
                                millennium, the Orcs were only a minor problem, but when Melkor (Morgoth) returned with
                                the
                                Silmarils he took full charge of them and soon unleashed them on Beleriand. The newly
                                organized Orcs killed Denethor, the King of the lightly armed Laiquendi, but were
                                eventually
                                defeated by Thingol and his allies. They besieged the Havens of the Falas under CÃ­rdan,
                                and
                                the siege wasn't broken until the arrival of the Ãoldor. The heavy losses that the
                                Sindar
                                suffered at the hands of the Orcs frightened them to the point that Melian, Queen of
                                Doriath
                                raised a great enchantment to protect their kingdom. The Laiquendi, who suffered the

                                the battle, hid themselves in Ossiriand under the cloak of secrecy, or took refuge in

                            <h2>Trolls</h2>
                            <p>Melkor created trolls before the First Age. They were very strong, but turned into stone
                                in
                                sunlight. Many trolls died in the War of Wrath, but some survived and joined the forces
                                of
                                Sauron, the greatest surviving servant of Melkor. In the Second and Third Age, trolls
                                were
                                among Sauron's most dangerous warriors. He created the Olog-hai, which were smarter than
                                earlier breeds of trolls. While most trolls could not bear exposure to sunlight without
                                turning to stone, the Olog-hai apparently could (to the same extent as Orcs); this
                                attribute
                                was mentioned in The Return of the King as making them particularly dangerous.


                                A mountain troll at the Black Gate, used for opening the gate

                                During Bilbo's quest to the Lonely Mountain, trolls were known to speak with thick
                                Cockney
                                accents, specifically three Hill-trolls who had dwelt on the Ettenmoors and moved down
                                to
                                the Trollshaws . They turned to stone when exposed to sunlight, for stone, as told in
                                The
                                Hobbit, is what trolls were originally made of. They enjoyed eating anything they could
                                get
                                their hands on. While threatening, the trolls in The Hobbit serve as a comic element.
                                They
                                even had normal names: Tom, Bert, and William (Bill) Huggins (the only one with a given
                                surname).

                                various Orcs within Moria. Boromir's Boromir's sword recoiled off
                                the
                                scaled hide of one troll. As
                                things seemed perilous, however, the trolls fled (although this was due to the approach
                                of
                                the Balrog, Durin's Bane). Sauron used Olog-hai in the Siege of Gondor and Battle of the
                                Pelennor Fields. In the subsequent Battle of the Black Gate, the hobbit Peregrin Took
                                killed
                                a large Olog-hai troll with his barrow-blade. As a result of the One Ring being
                                destroyed,
                                most of the trolls present at the battle were killed, and the others are known to have
                                fled..</p>

                            <h2>NazgÃ»l</h2>
                            <p>The NazgÃ»l (Black Speech for "Ringwraiths") or Ãlairi (Quenya[2]), also known as the
                                Black
                                Riders or simply The Nine, were the dreaded ring-servants of the Dark Lord Sauron in
                                Middle-earth throughout the Second and Third Ages, who in the later years of the Third
                                Age
                                dwelt in Minas Morgul and Dol Guldur.[3]</p>
                            <p>Nineteen Rings of Power were made in Eregion, forged by Celebrimbor. These were locked
                                away
                                in one of the safes of Eregion, but sixteen of them were captured by Sauron. He gave
                                nine of
                                them to great lords and warriors of Men, including three NÃºmenÃ³reans, and one Easterling
                                king. Sauron succeeded in corrupting the powerful Nine through his dominance over the
                                rings.
                                These Nine used the rings to achieve great power, wealth, and prestige in life, but as
                                time
                                passed the Rings continued to exert a corrupting influence. The Rings eventually
                                rendered
                                their bearers invisible to all but those who could see into the wraith world, and
                                enslaved
                                them to the will of Sauron. Their lives and their powers became bound to Sauron's via
                                the
                                One Ring; as Sauron grew or diminished, so too did the NazgÃ»l.

                                Three of the Ringwraiths may have been among the first and most powerful NÃºmenÃ³reans to
                                be
                                corrupted by Sauron, a thousand years before the Downfall: they revered Sauron, and
                                became
                                ensnared in his designs because of their lust for power or knowledge.

                                Only two of the Nine were ever named: the Witch-king of Angmar and KhamÃ»l the
                                Easterling.

                                The Nine were first observed around 2251 of the Second Age, and soon became Sauron's
                                primary
                                servants. Despite their great power and position as instruments of Sauron's will, not
                                much
                                is known of their activities during the Second Age. They were temporarily dispersed
                                after
                                Sauron's downfall in SA 3434 in the War of the Last Alliance. Though no longer able to
                                maintain physical form, just as Sauron was after losing the One Ring, both the NazgÃ»l
                                and
                                Sauron were able to endure as long as the Ring survived.</p>

                            <h2>Dragons</h2>
                            <p>Dragons were ancient, intelligent, powerful creatures, as feared as they were admired in
                                Middle-earth. Their exact origin is debated, though it was clearly stated that they were
                                created by Morgoth in some sense, millennia before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord
                                of
                                the Rings.

                                Dragons lived throughout the First, Second, and Third ages of Middle-earth and may have
                                lived longer. They were originally bred by Morgoth during the First Age to serve as
                                powerful
                                war beasts. The first dragon ever seen in Middle-earth was Glaurung, the father of
                                dragons,
                                whom Morgoth used to great effect during the fourth and fifth battles in the War of the
                                Jewels. Like most of the creatures made or twisted by Morgoth, they were capable of
                                reproducing independently. Dragons were sometimes referred to as serpents, great Worms,
                                or
                                simply Drakes, with the first two specifying the Wingless Dragons. In the First Age, the
                                greatest heirloom of the House of Hador was the Dragon-helm of Dor-lÃ³min, a helm of
                                great
                                weight that had as its crest an image of Glaurung's head.[4] After Glaurung, even
                                mightier
                                dragons were bred to serve Morgoth. The largest and most powerful dragon to ever live
                                was
                                Ancalagon the Black, who led his kind in the final charge against the Valar in the War
                                of
                                Wrath at the close of the First Age. Most of Morgoth's dragons, including Ancalagon,
                                were
                                killed in this battle.[5] However, some survived and fled eastward to the far north of
                                the
                                remaining Middle-earth, where, in later years, they would slowly multiply.


                                Smaug, by Alan Lee

                                Dragons in the Second Age and Third Age were a blight upon the Dwarves and all those who
                                hoarded treasure. Some, like Smaug the Golden[6] and Scatha the Worm[7], went from the
                                Withered Heath where they had bred[8] and invaded Dwarven kingdoms. Some peoples of Men
                                were
                                driven from their lands as well in the northeast, before the last centuries of the Third
                                Age, by certain dragons[9] among whom was Smaug.</p>

                            <p>Frodo Baggins, son of Drogo Baggins, was a hobbit of the Shire in the late Third Age. He
                                is
                                commonly considered Tolkien's most renowned character for his leading role in the Quest
                                of
                                the Ring, in which he bore the One Ring to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a
                                Ring-bearer, best friend to his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and was one of three hobbits
                                who
                                sailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the Third Age.
                            </p>
                            <p>Childhood
                                Much of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the ancestral home of the
                                Brandybuck family, including his mother (Primula Brandybuck). Frodo was known as
                                something
                                of a rascal, befriending Meriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and
                                causing
                                trouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Farmer Maggot's farm
                                Bamfurlong.[1]

                                In TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident
                                on
                                the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in Brandy Hall until his 99-year-old
                                "uncle" Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989. Bilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home at
                                Bag
                                End and made him his heir.[2]


                                Frodo with Bilbo during his 111th birthday

                                The two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of the Elvish
                                language
                                during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the lore of Middle-earth. The two shared
                                the
                                same birthday, September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12â14 of our calendar),
                                and
                                a party of special magnificence was held when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and
                                Bilbo
                                achieved the notable age of 111.

                                Bilbo gave a memorable birthday speech before playing a joke on his fellow hobbits by
                                using
                                the One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create
                                a
                                blinding flash where Bilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the party were left
                                confused
                                and disgruntled, and Bilbo was never again seen in the Shire.

                                Before departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long conversation with
                                Gandalf,
                                who finally persuaded him to voluntarily surrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it on the
                                fireplace mantel with a note for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.</p>

                                Elves, his gift for poetry, and his belief that the world contained greater wonders than
                                most hobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins) set him apart from
                                the
                                beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in J.R.R. Tolkien's novels) the theme of the
                                Elves sailing from Middle-earth, a subtle foreshadowing of Bilbo and Frodo's final
                                journey
                                across the sea from the Grey Havens. He lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known
                                commonly as "The Gaffer", on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. He had five
                                siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold.</p>

                        <p>Quest of the Ring
                            As "punishment" for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo regarding the dangers
                            of
                            the One Ring, Gandalf chose Sam to be Frodo's companion on his journey to Rivendell. Sam
                            saved
                            Frodo's life more than once during the quest to destroy the Ring, and would accompany him
                            all
                            the way to Mount Doom.

                            After leaving Bree, Sam became very close to the pony Bill. On arrival at the Doors of Durin
                            Bill had to be set loose as he could not pass through the Mines of Moria. This caused Sam
                            great
                            distress. In LothlÃ³rien Sam was given a gift by the Lady Galadriel; a small box containing
                            soil
                            from her garden along with a Mallorn seed.

                            After Shelob attacked and seemingly killed Frodo, Sam took the Ring, intending to complete
                            the
                            quest on his own. Because he held the Ring for a time, he was considered one of the
                            Ring-bearers
                            and during the time he possessed it the Ring tempted him with visions of a great garden all
                            for
                            himself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and temptations of the
                            Ring,
                            and returned it when he discovered Frodo alive in the Tower of Cirith Ungol.[1] He and Bilbo
                            were the only ones ever to have given up the Ring willingly, and only Sam surrendered it
                            readily.

                            When Orcs took Frodo's body, Sam overheard one of them saying that Frodo was still alive, so
                            he
                            followed them into the Tower of Cirith Ungol, determined to rescue Frodo. Once there he
                            found
                            that competing bands of Uruks and Morgul Orcs had rioted and killed one another over the
                            possession of Frodo's Mithril coat, thus making it easier for Sam to get to Frodo and escape
                            the
                            tower with him.

                            Sam and Frodo made their way to Mount Doom, disguised as Orcs along the way. The way to
                            Mount
                            Doom was filled with fiery rocks and pillows of ash which made it almost impossible for the
                            hobbits to pass. When Frodo collapsed from weakness, Sam carried him up the slopes of Mount
                            Doom, only to be stopped by Gollum. Sam delayed Gollum while Frodo continued towards the
                            Cracks
                            of Doom. Sam then rushed to follow Frodo, only to see Frodo renounce the quest and claim the
                            Ring as his own, putting it on his finger. Unbeknownst to Sam, Gollum had followed in his
                            tracks, and attacked him from behind. In the moments while Sam was dazed, Gollum attacked
                            Frodo,
                            and after a brief struggle took the Ring by force by biting off Frodo's finger. Gollum began
                            to
                            celebrate regaining the Ring, but in doing so slipped and fell to his death in the fiery
                            chasm
                            below, destroying the Ring in the process.[2</p>

                                Gandalf as a Maia named OlÃ³rin before leaving the Undying Lands - by Annie Claudine

                                Originally called OlÃ³rin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by
                                IlÃºvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the
                                Ainur who entered into EÃ¤.[2] In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served
                                ManwÃ«,
                                Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda[3], yet
                                his
                                ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the
                                Elves,
                                but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in
                                their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of
                                Nienna,
                                talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of IlÃºvatar and drawing those who listened
                                to
                                him out of despair.[3]

                                When the Valar decided to send the Istari (also called Wizards) to Middle-earth to
                                counsel
                                and assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, ManwÃ« and Varda included OlÃ³rin
                                among
                                the five to be sent. At first, OlÃ³rin was nervous and described himself as too weak and
                                afraid of Sauron. ManwÃ« understood, and told OlÃ³rin that such was a reason why he should
                                go,
                                to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One Ring, containing much of Sauron's power,
                                presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, ManwÃ« insisted that OlÃ³rin should go as the
                                third,
                                but Varda convinced him to send OlÃ³rin as the second instead.[4] He agreed, and prepared
                                for
                                OlÃ³rin's departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about the same
                                time
                                that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.</p>

                            <h2>Aragorn</h2>
                            <p>Aragorn II, son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as Elessar and Strider, was the
                                16th
                                and last Chieftain of the DÃºnedain of the North; later crowned King Elessar Telcontar
                                (March
                                1, 2931 - FO 120), the 26th King of Arnor, 35th King of Gondor and first High King of
                                Gondor
                                and Arnor since the short reign of Isildur. He was a great Ranger and warrior, and as
                                Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil, reforged and renamed AndÃºril, Flame of the
                                West, in the War of the Ring.</p>
                            <p>Aragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of AndÃºniÃ«
                                to
                                Elendil, High King of Arnor and Gondor. Like all of the kings before him, he was related
                                to
                                Elrond through the House of Elros. His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to FÃ­riel, descended
                                from
                                AnÃ¡rion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of both Isildur
                                and
                                AnÃ¡rion.

                                When he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing Orcs.
                                Aragorn
                                was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his
                                lineage
                                was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his
                                true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was
                                renamed "Estel" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.[1]


                                Young Aragorn with the shards of Narsil, by Anna Lee

                                Elrond revealed to "Estel" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, and gave to
                                him
                                the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil. Elrond withheld the Sceptre of AnnÃºminas
                                from
                                Aragorn until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time
                                that
                                Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her
                                mother's
                                homeland of LothlÃ³rien where she had been visiting her grandmother Galadriel.[1]

                                Aragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the DÃºnedain
                                and
                                left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his
                                people, the Rangers of the North, whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and
                                the
                                Angmar Wars centuries before.[1]

                                Aragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding Gandalf's
                                advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire inhabited
                                by
                                the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside
                                the

                            <p>Legolas was a Sindar Elf who was part of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age. Son

                                was valuable to the Fellowship in their journey across Middle-earth. He was well-known

                            <p>Early life
                                Legolas was the only son of Thranduil, King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. His exact
                                date of birth and mother's name are unknown.

                                War of the Ring
                                Legolas came to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, the great meeting held by the Elf
                                lord
                                Elrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss the escape of Gollum. When the council
                                was
                                choosing the "Nine Walkers" to pit against the "Nine Riders," Legolas volunteered to
                                represent the Elves, and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set
                                out
                                to destroy the One Ring.[2]


                                Legolas in combat with the Goblins during the Skirmish in Balin's Tomb

                                During their journey, Legolas would stay at the rear due to his keen eyes. On Caradhras,
                                Legolas was able to run nimbly over the snow, leaving behind little imprint, whereas his
                                companions struggled to plough through it.[3] When Gandalf gave his counsel, Legolas
                                voted
                                against passing through Moria. In the morning, the Fellowship was waylaid by Wargs and
                                Legolas fought in their defence. After the battle, he picked up his arrows, save one
                                which
                                was damaged.[4]

                                Gimli quarreled with him in Moria (which was not unexpected considering the ancient
                                quarrel
                                between Elves and Dwarves) - Legolas' father Thranduil had once imprisoned Gimli's
                                father,
                                GlÃ³in.[5]

                                He and Gimli became friends, however, when Gimli greeted the Elf, Lady Galadriel, with
                                gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from LothlÃ³rien, Legolas was given a new
                                Galadhrim longbow.[6] While the Fellowship was travelling over the River Anduin, he used
                                his
                                new bow to shoot an overhead NazgÃ»l on a Fellbeast with one masterful shot in the
                                dark.[7]

                                After the breaking of the Fellowship, Legolas and Aragorn sang a song of lament for the
                                fall
                                of Boromir.[8] He then led the way as he, Aragorn and Gimli raced through Rohan after
                                the
                                Uruk-hai who had taken Merry and Pippin. During that week, he was given a grey horse
                                named
                                Arod, on which he and Gimli would often ride together, from Ãomer and his Ãored.[9]</p>

                            <h2>Gimli</h2>
                            <p>Gimli, son of GlÃ³in, was a Dwarf of the House of Durin and a member of the Fellowship of
                                the
                                Ring. Unlike other Dwarves, he readily fought alongside Elves in the War of the Ring
                                against
                                Sauron at the end of the Third Age. After the defeat of Sauron, in the early Fourth Age,
                                he
                                was given the lordship over the Glittering Caves at Helm's Deep.</p>
                            <p>Early life

                                Gimli's mother (left) and young Gimli (right), as depicted in GlÃ³in's locket in The
                                Hobbit:
                                The Desolation of Smaug

                                Born in TA 2879, Gimli was the son of GlÃ³in and a nephew of Ãin, both former companions
                                of
                                Bilbo Baggins. He was a descendant of Durin the Deathless, father of the first house of
                                the
                                Dwarven people. Gimli was descended from, but was not a member of the royal line.
                                Through
                                his father, Gimli was also the first cousin once removed of Balin, Lord of Moria, and
                                his
                                brother Dwalin, two more former companions of Bilbo. It is also stated in Unfinished
                                Tales
                                that Gimli was prevented from traveling with his father on the Quest of Erebor because
                                Thorin and Company thought him too young, though Gimli, being in his sixties, considered
                                himself ripe for adventure and was disappointed to be left behind.[1]

                                Involvement with the Ring

                                Gimli without a helmet

                                In TA 3018, an emissary from Mordor approached the King under the Mountain, DÃ¡in II,
                                with
                                offers of friendship and requests for news of a Hobbit bearing a Ring, as Sauron had
                                become
                                aware that the name Baggins was known to the Dwarf king. Not trusting the messenger,
                                DÃ¡in
                                sent GlÃ³in and Gimli to Rivendell to seek the advice of Elrond, and to warn Bilbo that
                                the
                                Enemy was seeking him. As a result, they were summoned to the Council of Elrond, where
                                Elrond believed they would find the answers to their questions and would be able to
                                contribute. Whilst there, GlÃ³in told Elrond of the messenger and made reference to
                                Balin,
                                who had entered Moria and attempted to reclaim it. However, he had not sent any word to
                                King
                                DÃ¡in II for over twenty years, and GlÃ³in was concerned. The Council ultimately chose to
                                send
                                Frodo Baggins to Mordor to destroy the Ring and decided that a small fellowship should
                                go
                                with him. Gimli volunteered to accompany the Fellowship to Mordor to destroy the One
                                Ring.[2]</p>

                            <h2>Boromir</h2>
                            <p>Boromir was a valiant warrior of Gondor, renowned for his prowess in combat and skill on
                                the
                                battlefield. He was the eldest son of Denethor II, who was Steward of Gondor during the
                                War
                                of the Ring, and his wife Finduilas. Even the people of Rohan admired him, particularly
                                Ãomer. He was the older brother of Faramir.</p>
                            <p>Boromir was born in the year TA 2978. He was the eldest child of Denethor II, the last
                                Ruling
                                Steward of Gondor and his wife Finduilas, and was the heir to the Stewardship. When
                                Boromir
                                was only ten years old, his mother died. Consequently, his father became grim and came
                                to
                                prefer Boromir over his brother, Faramir. Despite this fact, Boromir looked after his
                                younger brother and they became very close. Boromir devoted himself to leading his
                                people
                                and fought in the battle for the eastern part of Osgiliath in TA 3018. He, his brother,
                                and
                                two others were the only survivors of the unit that held the bridge until its
                                destruction;
                                they had to swim the River Anduin to reach safety.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Boromir lost his horse in Tharbad and travelled the rest of the way on foot. The journey took
                            110
                            days.[1] He arrived at the beginning of the Council of Elrond where he described how Gondor
                            was
                            defending itself from Mordor and tried to convince them to give the One Ring to Gondor,
                            where he
                            felt it would be kept safe. But the council did not agree that the One Ring should go to
                            Gondor,
                            deciding that the only safe course was to destroy it.[1]

                            Boromir joined the Fellowship of the Ring and was warned by Elrond not to blow the Horn of
                            Gondor until they were close to Gondor and in dire need.[1] On the voyage south Boromir
                            advocated taking the Gap of Rohan, but was overruled as this lay too close to Isengard. He
                            proved his worth as a capable warrior in Moria and assisted Aragorn in fighting off a large
                            number of Orcs. After the loss of Gandalf and the Fellowship's departure from Moria, Boromir
                            expressed opposition to Aragorn's decision to continue to LothlÃ³rien, arguing that to go
                            south
                            was better. He believed the stories told in Gondor that Galadriel's magic would harm them.
                            He
                            eventually agreed to go after Aragorn assured him the Elves would help them. In LothlÃ³rien,
                            Boromir was disturbed by what he felt was Galadriel's testing of his mind, and he was
                            suspicious
                            of her motives.[2] Before leaving LothlÃ³rien he was given the gift of an Elven-cloak and a
                            golden belt.[3]</p>

                                Baggins' youngest and closest friends. He was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring
                                and,
                                after the War of the Ring, became thirty-second Thain of the Shire.</p>
                            <p>Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck was a Hobbit of the Shire and one of Frodo Baggins cousins
                                and
                                closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest in the maps of
                                Middle-earth. He was also one of the nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring, and
                                later became the eighth Master of Buckland.</p>

                            <h2>Saruman</h2>
                            <p>Saruman, also known as Saruman the White, was first of the Istari (Wizards), emissaries
                                of
                                the Valar who were sent to Middle-earth in the Third Age to help in countering the
                                returned
                                Sauron. He was the order's chief and the head of the White Council that opposed the
                                Enemy.
                                However, in time, the Wizard came to wish to share in the Dark Lord's power as the
                                quasi-equal lieutenant by his side, or by claiming the One Ring first. He betrayed the
                                White
                                Council and his people and began serving Sauron. As Sauron's two-faced vassal, Saruman
                                pledged Isengard's nominal fealty to Mordor and assailed the Kingdom of Rohan in the War
                                of
                                the Ring, in which he was defeated.

                                After Sauron's downfall, Saruman journeyed to the Shire, dragging GrÃ­ma along, and
                                imposed a
                                terror regime with him as the petty thug-lord. However, the oppressed Hobbits rallied
                                against him and the overthrown Wizard was backstabbed by the mistreated Wormtongue and
                                his
                                houseless spirit was denied the West.

                                He is one of the few characters in The Lord of the Rings who is morally "grey" - being
                                neither a fully-committed minion of the One Enemy nor an agent of good.</p>

                            <p>Saruman was originally one of the powerful Maiar of AulÃ« the Smith named Curumo (later in
                                Sindarin, CurunÃ­r).[1] As Tarindor, Saruman was among the Five Guardians chosen to
                                protect
                                the newly-awakened Elves from the evils of Melkor and Sauron.

                                In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by ManwÃ«, king of the Valar,
                                shortly
                                after Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Though the Dark Lord was
                                overthrown, he had not been effectively vanquished and his Shadow began to fall upon
                                Middle-earth a second time. It was decided to send five emissaries to Middle-earth.
                                These
                                should be "mighty, peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh," as
                                they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron, but the Wizards were
                                forbidden from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.[2]

                                Curumo was one of those who volunteered, whereas the last one, OlÃ³rin, (later known as
                                "Gandalf") was commanded by ManwÃ« to go too. It was from this point that Curumo began to
                                be
                                jealous of OlÃ³rin, due to Varda's decision to send OlÃ³rin not as the third Istari, but
                                as
                                the second. He also was charged to take Aiwendil (later called "Radagast") to please
                                Yavanna, which Curumo did not wish to do, and this led to contempt for the latter
                                Wizard.
                                The others who were chosen were Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo then was
                                appointed overall leader of the group.[2]

                                Arrival in Middle-earth

                                The arrival of the Istari in Middle-earth

                                The five wizards arrived separately at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador around the
                                year TA 1000. Only the keeper of the havens, CÃ­rdan the Shipwright, knew Saruman's
                                identity
                                and origin. Saruman would later discover that CÃ­rdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to
                                Gandalf upon their first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Saruman was immediately
                                considered the head of the order while Gandalf was not, CÃ­rdan had divined Gandalf as
                                the
                                wisest and greatest of the wizards. Saruman's jealousy of Gandalf grew from these
                                events,
                                perhaps because he feared that he would eventually supplant him as chief of the wizards.

                                The White Messenger and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth. After
                                one
                                and a half millennia, Saruman returned to the west, just as Sauron's power was growing
                                again
                                in Dol Guldur.</p>

                            <h2>Sauron</h2>
                            <p>Sauron (Quenya; IPA [ËsaÊron] or [ËÎ¸aÊron]), the eponymous Lord of the Rings, was the
                                greatest subversive Maia, the maker of the One Ring, renowned student of the Vala AulÃ«,
                                and
                                the most trusted lieutenant of Morgoth. After Morgoth's ousting by the Valar, Sauron
                                became
                                the second Dark Lord and sought to conquer Middle-earth through guileful trickery -
                                chiefly
                                in the Rings of Power - or overwhelming legions.

                                At the end of the Second Age, Sauron caused the downfall of NÃºmenor, and was then
                                defeated
                                in Mordor in the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men united under Gil-galad and
                                Elendil. In the final battle, Isildur managed to cut the One Ring from him, dismantling
                                his
                                corporeal form and ridding much of his power. After centuries lying dormant, rebuilding
                                strength and stirring awake evil things, Sauron returned to power late in the Third Age,
                                but
                                was vanquished at the destruction of his Ring in Mount Doom, by Frodo Baggins, and his
                                spirit was claimed by the Void.

                                To the Sindar of Beleriand, Sauron was known as Gorthaur in the First Age.</p>
                            <h2>Years of the lamps</h2>
                            <p>Years of the Lamps
                                Sauron's original name was Mairon. He was the mightiest Maia of the Vala AulÃ« the Smith,
                                and
                                learned much from AulÃ« in the ways of smithing and handiwork, becoming a great
                                craftsman,
                                and "mighty in the lore of" AulÃ«'s people.[2] He was among the most powerful Maiar.

                                During this time, Mairon was as Eru had created him: good and uncorrupted. His greatest
                                virtue was his love of order and perfection, and dislike of anything wasteful. However,
                                this
                                would also prove to be the cause of his downfall, as Mairon saw in Melkor the will and
                                power
                                that would help him achieve his personal ends quicker than if he pursued them alone.
                                However, while Melkor wanted to either control or destroy Middle-earth itself, Mairon's
                                desire was to dominate the minds and wills of its creatures for what he perceived to be
                                their own benefit. To see his marvelous designs through, Mairon sought to increase his
                                innate power and this power in time became the end in itself; so he was ensnared by
                                Melkor,
                                entering his following and soon becoming his (self-centered) chief agent.

                                After allying with Morgoth, Mairon maintained apparent fidelity to the Valar, but
                                secretly
                                fed Morgoth information of their dealings. It was only when Morgoth established his
                                strongholds in Middle-earth that Mairon left Valinor and openly declared his allegiance,
                                becoming a recognized foe of the Valar.

                                Before Melkor's captivity, Sauron commanded the fortress of Angband and acted as his
                                lieutenant. At the beginning of the Battle of the Powers, the Valar forces leveled
                                Angband
                                with little difficulty, though it is not known for certain if the demonic Maia was still
                                present when the fortress was attacked. When Utumno was sacked and Melkor captured,
                                Sauron
                                was nowhere to be found, and in their haste to both capture the Black Enemy and remove
                                him
                                from Middle-earth, the Valar paid little heed to the latter's most terrible servants.[3]

                                The Sindar Elves in Beleriand called him Gorthaur, meaning "dread abomination"[4],while
                                others of the Eldar named him Sauron, meaning "the abhorred" or "the abominable" (a
                                mockery
                                of his original name).</p>

                            <h2>MIDDLE EARTH</h2>
                            <p>"Middle-earth", Endor in Quenya (Ennor in Sindarin), and in The Book of Lost Tales the
                                Great
                                Lands, are names used for the habitable parts of Arda after the final ruin of Beleriand,
                                east across the Belegaer from Aman.
                                This continent was north of the Hither Lands shown in the Ambarkanta, and west of the
                                East
                                Sea; and from the beginning of Arda to the end of the Second Age it underwent dramatic
                                geographical changes, caused by Eru IlÃºvatar, the Valar and Melkor.</p>
                            <p>Tolkien first used the term "Middle-earth" in the early 1930s in place of the earlier
                                terms
                                "Great Lands", "Outer Lands", and "Hither Lands" to describe the same region in his
                                stories.
                                "Middle-earth" is specifically intended to describe the lands east of the Great Sea
                                (Belegaer), thus excluding Aman, but including Harad and other mortal lands not visited
                                in
                                Tolkien's stories. Many people apply the name to the entirety of Tolkien's world or
                                exclusively to the lands described in The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The
                                Silmarillion.

                                In ancient Germanic and mythology, the universe was believed to consist of multiple
                                interconnected physical worlds (in Nordic mythology 9, in West Germanic and English
                                mythology, 8). The world of Men, the Middle-earth, lay in the centre of this universe.
                                The
                                lands of Elves, gods, and Giants lay across an encircling sea. The land of the Dead lay
                                beneath the Middle-earth. A rainbow bridge, Bifrost Bridge, extended from Middle-earth
                                to
                                Asgard across the sea. An outer sea encircled the seven other worlds (Vanaheim, Asgard,
                                Alfheim, Svartalfheim, Muspellheim, Niflheim, and Jotunheim). In this conception, a
                                "world"
                                was more equivalent to a racial homeland than a physically separate world.</p>

                            <h2>Gondor</h2>
                            <p>Gondor was the most prominent kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by Rohan to the
                                north,
                                Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea to the west, and Mordor to the east.
                                Its
                                first capital was Osgiliath, moved to Minas Anor in TA 1640. This city, later renamed
                                Minas
                                Tirith, remained the capital of Gondor for the rest of the Third Age and into the Fourth
                                Age; other major fortresses included Pelargir, Dol Amroth in Belfalas and Minas Ithil.

                                Gondor was founded by the brothers Isildur and AnÃ¡rion, exiles from NÃºmenor. Gondor was
                                the
                                sister kingdom of Arnor, whose line of kings came from Isildur, while the line of the
                                Kings
                                of Gondor descended from AnÃ¡rion. Gondor was at the height of its power in its early
                                years
                                due to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed. However, continued
                                attacks by allies of Sauron, civil war, and a devastating plague caused it to gradually
                                decline over the course of the Third Age until Sauron's final defeat and the crowning of
                                Aragorn II Elessar. Following that time the power of Gondor once again expanded, and the
                                former lands of Arnor were united with it under the banner of the Reunited Kingdom.

                                In all, there were thirty-one Kings of Gondor after AnÃ¡rion, who was slain in the War of
                                the
                                Last Alliance at the Siege of Barad-dÃ»r.</p>

                                Elendil, the first King of Gondor

                                Before the Downfall of NÃºmenor, Gondor was home to many NÃºmenÃ³rean colonists, who either
                                mixed
                                blood with the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them into Ras
                                Morthil,
                                Dunland, and DrÃºadan Forest. Gondor, at a latitude comparable to Venice, was a more
                                fertile
                                region than Arnor to the north, and therefore it already had a larger population before
                                the
                                ships of Elendil's sons arrived, including a well-established city, Pelargir.

                                The Faithful, or Elendili, from NÃºmenor were given a warm reception upon their arrival
                                by
                                those
                                that had already colonized Middle-earth. The colonists west of Anduin accepted Elendil's
                                claim
                                to kingship over them. South of the Great River, however, the former King's Men did not
                                accept
                                his claim, becoming the Black NÃºmenÃ³reans.


                                Gondor joined the Last Alliance of Men and Elves against Sauron

                                Centred on the Anduin river, the newly founded Kingdom of Gondor was the closest to
                                Mordor
                                and
                                was the first to be attacked when the War of the Last Alliance began in SA 3429.
                                Sauron's
                                forces
                                overran Minas Ithil but failed to capture the capital, Osgiliath. Gondor participated in
                                the
                                Last Alliance of Elves and Men which overthrew Sauron for the first time at the very end
                                of
                                the
                                Second Age, when Isildur cut the One Ring from the Dark Lord's finger.

                                Gondor prospers
                                After the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily, only interrupted by a series of
                                Easterling invasions after TA 492, resulting in large conquests in Rhovanion, the
                                East-lands.
                                While the power of Gondor's sister kingdom Arnor peaked at this time, before it broke
                                into
                                various successor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come. Gondor's great
                                cities,
                                Minas
                                Anor, Minas Ithil, Osgiliath and Pelargir, only grew and the DÃºnedain of Gondor ruled
                                over
                                more
                                and more of the lesser men of Middle-earth.</p>

                            <h2>Mordor</h2>
                            <p>Mordor was a black, volcanic plain in the southeast of Middle-earth to the east of
                                Gondor,
                                Ithilien, and the great river Anduin. Mordor was chosen by Sauron as his realm because
                                of
                                the mountain ranges surrounding it on three sides, creating a natural fortress against
                                his
                                enemies.</p>
                            <p>Early history
                                The Mount Doom was created by Morgoth during the First Age. In unknown moment of First
                                Age,
                                perhaps shortly around the War of Wrath, Shelob left the Nan Dungortheb and settled
                                there
                                with her offspring. Sauron settled in Mordor 1,000 years after the end of the First Age,
                                and
                                it remained the centre of his power for the whole of the Second Age and again at the end
                                of
                                the Third Age of Middle-earth. In the north-western corner of this land stood Mount
                                Doom,
                                where Sauron had forged the One Ring. Near Mount Doom stood Sauron's stronghold
                                Barad-dÃ»r.
                                After this time, Sauron was known as the Dark Lord of Mordor.


                                Sauron looking over the Orc Army of Gorgoroth

                                For two and a half thousand years, Sauron ruled Mordor uninterruptedly. Having wrought
                                the
                                Ring, it was from there that he launched the attack upon the Elves of Eregion in the War
                                of
                                the Elves and Sauron. He was repelled by the Men of NÃºmenor. He later opposed NÃºmenor,
                                but
                                such was their power that his own servants deserted him and he was captured by the
                                NÃºmenÃ³reans and brought to their island kingdom, eventually causing its destruction (see
                                the
                                Downfall of NÃºmenor). Immediately after NÃºmenor's destruction, Sauron returned to Mordor
                                as
                                a spirit and resumed his rule.

                                The Last Alliance and Third Age

                                The battle of the Siege of Barad-dÃ»r

                                Sauron's rule was interrupted again when his efforts to destroy Gondor failed; his
                                forces
                                were driven back and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men formed to oppose him. After the
                                Battle of Dagorlad the army of the Last Alliance entered Mordor and besieged the
                                Barad-dÃ»r
                                for seven years. Eventually Sauron came forth and was defeated in a final battle on the
                                slopes of Mount Doom. For about 1600 years, Mordor was guarded by Gondor in order to
                                prevent
                                evil from returning. The Towers of the Teeth, Durthang and the Tower of Cirith Ungol
                                were
                                built by Gondor to watch the major entry points to the dark land. Gorgoroth during this
                                time
                                was desolate, with the Barad-dÃ»r levelled down to its foundations.

                                However following the Great Plague in TA 1636 the watch on Mordor failed and evil began
                                to
                                creep back in. Sauron eventually used the Wainriders to distract and weaken Gondor, and
                                the
                                NazgÃ»l re-entered in TA 1980. They reclaimed Mordor and started to rebuild its might.
                                Minas
                                Ithil was conquered by the Nine Ringwraiths in TA 2002 and Gondor's abandoned fortresses
                                were occupied by evil creatures. By the time Sauron returned to Mordor in TA 2942 after
                                his
                                false defeat at Dol Guldur (in the events that took place at the time of Bilbo Baggins's
                                quest), Mordor was too strong to be captured by any military might that was available in
                                Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. Sauron declared himself openly in TA 2951 and
                                Mount Doom burst into flame three years later.</p>

                            <p>Rivendell, also known as Imladris in Sindarin, was an Elven town and the house of Elrond
                                located in Middle-earth. It is described as "The Last Homely House East of the Sea" in
                                reference to Valinor, which was west of the Great Sea in Aman.</p>
                            <h2>History</h2>
                            <p>Second Age
                                War of the Elves and Sauron
                                Rivendell was established by Elrond in the Second Age of Middle-earth in SA 1697. In the
                                War
                                of the Elves and Sauron, Eregion was laid waste and Elrond was sent from Lindon with a
                                host
                                of Elves to aid Eregion in resisting Sauron. However Elrond arrived too late and along
                                with
                                the refugees from Eregion was forced to retreat back to a valley which they made into a
                                stronghold. This was the beginning of Rivendell. Sauron laid siege to it but with the
                                arrival of the NÃºmenÃ³reans the besieging force was destroyed.

                                The Last Alliance
                                Following the establishment of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men the hosts of Gil-galad
                                and
                                Elendil marched to Imladris and made camp there to prepare their arms and then proceeded
                                over the High Pass southeast to Dagorlad.[1]

                                Third Age
                                Following the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, the last surviving son of Isildur,
                                Valandil
                                was fostered by Elrond in Rivendell until ready to take up his throne eight years later.

                                When Angmar rose to power in the fourteenth century of the Third Age, Rivendell was
                                again
                                besieged during the period TA 1356 to TA 1409. This siege was broken by reinforcements
                                brought over the mountains from LothlÃ³rien and Angmar was subdued for a time.

                                However in TA 1974 Arthedain fell to Angmar. Elrond then sent Glorfindel and a host of
                                Elves
                                to meet with the armies of EÃ¤rnil II and CÃ­rdan, defeating Angmar for good at the Battle
                                of
                                Fornost. After the fall of Angmar the heirs of Isildur were fostered in Rivendell.

                                Quest for Erebor
                                During the Quest of Erebor, Bilbo Baggins and the Company of Thorin stopped off at
                                Rivendell. Bilbo described it as "a perfect house, whether you like food or sleep or
                                story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of
                                them
                                all."[2] After the quest, Bilbo and Gandalf returned there and were greeted again by
                                Elrond
                                and the Elves.[3]

                                War of the Ring

                                Imladris at the time of the War of the Ring

                                Years later, Frodo Baggins and his Hobbit companions journeyed to Rivendell, where they
                                met
                                with Bilbo, who had retired there after his eleventy-first birthday. Several other
                                Elves,
                                Dwarves and Men also arrived at Rivendell on separate errands;[4] at the Council of
                                Elrond
                                they learned that the fates of all of their kind were related to that of the One Ring.

                                Fourth Age
                                Elrond departed Rivendell in TA 3021, marking the end of the Third Age. Afterward,
                                Rivendell
                                was for a time the home of his sons Elladan and Elrohir and also of Celeborn. It is
                                untold
                                when Rivendell was finally abandoned.</p>

                            <h2>Rohan</h2>
                            <p>Rohan, or the Riddermark (Rohirric), was a great kingdom of Men located in the land once
                                known as Calenardhon, situated in the plains between the Misty Mountains and the White
                                Mountains. The land of Rohan extended from the banks of the River Isen in the west, up
                                to
                                the East wall of Rohan and shores of the River Anduin in the east. The forest of Fangorn
                                lay
                                on its border, and the Elven forest of LothlÃ³rien lay north of the River Limlight.

                                The land was known as "Rohan" to the Men of Gondor, and its people the Rohirrim, meaning
                                'the Horse-lords', but the people of Rohan called themselves the Eorlingas, sons of Eorl
                                the
                                Young, first King of Rohan. The province of Calenardhon was given in gift to Eorl and
                                his
                                people by Cirion, Steward of Gondor, in thanks for their service to Gondor in battle

                                the Balchoth. Eorl swore an oath of friendship, and of aid when summoned, to the Lords
                                of
                                Gondor, and thus the Rohirrim became the greatest ally of the Men of Gondor from the
                                later
                                part of the Third Age and beyond. They were known for their cavalry and horse mastery,
                                which
                                was crucial in battles such as the Battle of the Hornburg and at the Pelennor Fields.

                            <p>Tolkien first used the term "Middle-earth" in the early 1930s in place of the earlier
                                terms
                                "Great Lands", "Outer Lands", and "Hither Lands" to describe the same region in his
                                stories.
                                "Middle-earth" is specifically intended to describe the lands east of the Great Sea
                                (Belegaer), thus excluding Aman, but including Harad and other mortal lands not visited
                                in
                                Tolkien's stories. Many people apply the name to the entirety of Tolkien's world or
                                exclusively to the lands described in The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The
                                Silmarillion.

                                In ancient Germanic and mythology, the universe was believed to consist of multiple
                                interconnected physical worlds (in Nordic mythology 9, in West Germanic and English
                                mythology, 8). The world of Men, the Middle-earth, lay in the centre of this universe.
                                The
                                lands of Elves, gods, and Giants lay across an encircling sea. The land of the Dead lay
                                beneath the Middle-earth. A rainbow bridge, Bifrost Bridge, extended from Middle-earth
                                to
                                Asgard across the sea. An outer sea encircled the seven other worlds (Vanaheim, Asgard,
                                Alfheim, Svartalfheim, Muspellheim, Niflheim, and Jotunheim). In this conception, a
                                "world"
                                was more equivalent to a racial homeland than a physically separate world.</p>

                            <h2>Shire</h2>
                            <p>The Shire was a realm in northwestern Middle-earth, inhabited by the hobbits. It was
                                located
                                in the region of Eriador.

                                By the late Third Age it was one of the few heavily-populated areas left in Eriador. Its
                                name in Westron was SÃ»za, "Shire," or SÃ»zat, "The Shire." Contrary to popular
                                misconception,
                                the Shire was not the birthplace of Frodo Baggins, as he was born in Buckland, which at
                                the
                                time was not formally part of the Shire despite being colonized by Shire hobbits.

                                At the end of the Third Age, Saruman (known then as Sharkey) tried to take control of it
                                for
                                a very short period, but was killed in the Battle of Bywater, which ended the War of the
                                Ring.</p>
                            <p>The Shire was settled by hobbits in the year TA 1601 (Year 1 in Shire Reckoning). The
                                hobbits
                                (who originally lived in the Vales of Anduin) had migrated west over the Misty Mountains
                                in
                                the centuries before, and lived in Dunland and parts of the depopulated Arnor
                                splinter-realms Cardolan and Rhudaur before coming to the Shire. It has been speculated
                                that
                                the hobbits had originally moved west to escape the evils of Mirkwood, and the shadow of
                                Dol
                                Guldur.

                                The Shire was a part of Arthedain and as such a part of Arnor. The hobbits were granted
                                official permission from King Argeleb II at Norbury to settle in the Shire, which had
                                become
                                depopulated in the Great Plague, and was seen as the King's hunting grounds. The hobbits
                                considered themselves to be subjects of the King, and sent contingents of archers to the
                                great battles Arthedain fought against the Witch-king of Angmar. For reasons unknown,
                                Angmar
                                did not attack the Shire after it conquered Arthedain. Tales claim that some hobbit
                                bowmen
                                were involved at the Battle of Fornost, though no tales of it exist in the records of
                                Men.
                                After the fall of Arthedain in TA 1974, the Shire became in effect a free land, with the
                                Thain's office replacing royal authority.</p>

                            <h2>Moria</h2>
                            <p>Khazad-dÃ»m, commonly known as Moria or the Dwarrowdelf, was an underground kingdom
                                beneath
                                the Misty Mountains. It was known for being the ancient realm of the Dwarves of Durin's
                                Folk, and the most famed of all Dwarven realms.</p>
                            <p>The Dwarrowdelf was founded by Durin 'the Deathless' in the far distant past, long before
                                the
                                creation of the Sun and Moon in the Years of the Trees. Durin had awakened at Mount
                                Gundabad
                                not long after the Elves first awoke, and as eldest among the Fathers of the Dwarves was
                                acknowledged as preeminent among them, a status subsequently inherited by his
                                descendants,
                                the Kings of the Longbeards.

                                From Mount Gundabad, Durin made his way south until according to legend, Durin
                                ultimately
                                found "a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains, above which three
                                white
                                peaks were shining".[2] Within this heavily wooded valley, a long series of short
                                waterfalls
                                led down to a long, oval lake, which appeared to have a magical quality: "There, like
                                jewels
                                sunk in the deep shone glinting stars, though sunlight was in the sky above".[2]
                                Perceiving
                                these stars as a crown glittering above his head, Durin took this as an auspicious sign,
                                and
                                named the lake Kheled-zÃ¢ram, the Mirrormere.

                                The three peaks overshadowing the lake he named Barazinbar 'the Redhorn', Zirakzigil
                                'the
                                Silvertine' and BundushathÃ»r, 'Cloudyhead'. The icy cold springs below the lake he
                                called
                                Kibil-nÃ¢la (the source of the Silverlode), and the valley itself he gave the name
                                Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale. Durin chose the eastward-facing caves above Kheled-zÃ¢ram
                                as
                                the earliest beginnings of his new stronghold.[3]

                                All of these places became revered amongst Durin's people in later days. His descendants
                                erected a rune-carved stone monolith, Durin's Stone, on the site where he had first
                                looked
                                into the Mirrormere, and although it had become indecipherably weatherworn by the end of
                                the
                                Third Ageâbroken, cracked and fadedâthe influence of Durin I, the founding king of
                                Khazad-dÃ»m, was never forgotten.

                                The long reign of Khazad-dÃ»m's first king was a golden age, remembered as Durin's Day
                                (this
                                name was also applied to the Dwarvish New Year). During that period Khazad-dÃ»m grew
                                continuously in size and population, until it became the "greatest of all the mansions
                                of
                                the Dwarves",[4] even before the return of the Ãoldor to Middle-earth. By that time,
                                Khazad-dÃ»m was already "a name and a rumour from the words of the Dwarves of the Blue
                                Mountains"[4] to all the Eldar of Beleriand.

                                During the reign of Durin the Deathless some of the wonders of Dwarvish architecture
                                were
                                built in Khazad-dÃ»m: Durin's Bridge, the Second Hall, the Endless Stair and Durin's
                                Tower.

                                After his death, the reputation of Durin's realm continued to grow, not merely due to
                                his
                                spiritual ascendancy over the other Fathers of the Dwarves as their eldest, or to
                                Dwarrowdelf's growing size, but to its great wealth founded upon the uniquely precious
                                metal
                                mithril, which was universally prized yet found nowhere else in Middle-earth.</p>

                                major
                                fortresses of Gondor, and held within it one of the realm's palantÃ­ri.

                                However, in the latter half of the Third Age, the stronghold came into the possession of
                                Saruman, becoming his home and personal domain until his defeat in the War of the Ring.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the centuries following the Great Plague the land of Calenardhon became depopulated
                                and
                                the last Warden of Orthanc was recalled to Minas Tirith. Isengard remained garrisoned by
                                a
                                small company, led by a hereditary captain, much as happened at Aglarond at the time. At
                                first messengers were still sent to the fortress by the Stewards, although these
                                dwindled
                                and then eventually ceased entirely.

                                In TA 2510, after Calenardhon was given to the ÃothÃ©od by Cirion, Steward of Gondor, and
                                became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and the company of Aglarond removed to
                                the
                                northern fortress, although the rest of Gondor had virtually forgotten it. The small
                                guard
                                intermarried much with the Dunlendings, until the place became a Dunlending fortress in
                                all
                                but name. Orthanc, however, remained closed, as the Steward of Gondor held the keys.
                                Isengard soon became all but deserted.[4]

                                During the rule of Rohan's King DÃ©or, in TA 2710, the line of hereditary captains
                                commanding
                                the fortress died out and Isengard became openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Using Isengard
                                as
                                their base, the Dunlendings continued to raid Rohan during the reign of DÃ©or's son Gram,
                                until during the rule of Gram's son Helm Hammerhand a Dunlending lord, Freca and his son
                                Wulf nearly managed to destroy the Rohirrim. The Rohirrim eventually won, taking
                                Isengard by
                                starving out the Dunlendings in TA 2759 and guarding it for Gondor.[5]


                                Saruman, outside Orthanc

                                At this time Saruman the White suddenly reappeared from the East, and he offered to
                                guard
                                Isengard. The Steward of Gondor Beren gladly gave him the keys to Orthanc, and Saruman
                                settled there. After him the valley became known as Nan CurunÃ­r, or "Wizard's Vale". At
                                first Saruman was merely Warden of the Tower on behalf of Gondor, but as his pride grew
                                and
                                fall began, he took the fortress for his own in TA 2953.

                                During the War of the Ring, Isengard was Saruman's base of operations against the
                                Rohirrim,
                                and he defiled the valley, cutting down its trees and grass and replacing them with
                                stone
                                and machinery. He dammed and diverted the Isen, possibly for use as hydropower.
                                Isengard's
                                valley was honeycombed with deep pits, used for breeding Orcs and forging weapons.
                                Eventually, an army of Ents and Huorns led by Treebeard of Fangorn, attacked Isengard,
                                wrecking all of Saruman's industries, though unable to force entry into or damage
                                Orthanc.


                                Isengard at full military power

                                The Hobbits Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, as the new "doorwardens", received
                                ThÃ©oden King of Rohan, Aragorn, and Gandalf at the gates. Saruman was confronted but
                                refused
                                to beg for pardon, and he was kept under Treebeard's guard together with his servant
                                GrÃ­ma
                                Wormtongue. Saruman abandoned Isengard after Sauron's defeat, playing off Treebeard's
                                hatred
                                of caging any living thing in order to manipulate him into letting him leave. It was
                                planned
                                by Sauron that Isengard would be given to his loyal ambassador, the Mouth of Sauron,
                                after
                                Saruman's demise.[6]</p>

                            <h2>The Fellowship of the Ring</h2>
                            <p>The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes of the epic novel[2] The Lord of
                                the
                                Rings by the English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It is followed by The Two Towers and The
                                Return of the King. It takes place in the fictional universe of Middle-earth, and was
                                originally published on 29 July 1954 in the United Kingdom.

                                The volume consists of a foreword, in which the author discusses his writing of The Lord
                                of
                                the Rings, a prologue titled "Concerning Hobbits, and other matters", and the main
                                narrative
                                in Book I and Book II.</p>

                            <p>Tolkien envisioned The Lord of the Rings as a single volume work divided into six
                                sections he
                                called "books" along with extensive appendices. The original publisher decided to split
                                the
                                work into three parts.

                                Before the decision to publish The Lord of the Rings in three volumes was made, Tolkien
                                had
                                hoped to publish the novel in one volume, possibly also combined with The
                                Silmarillion.[3]
                                However, he had proposed titles for the individual six sections. Of the two books that
                                comprise what became The Fellowship of the Ring the first was to be called The First
                                Journey
                                or The Ring Sets Out. The name of the second was The Journey of the Nine Companions or
                                The
                                Ring Goes South. The titles The Ring Sets Out and The Ring Goes South were used in the
                                Millennium edition. In many other editions, the books are untitled.</p>
                            <p>The volume contains a Prologue for readers who have not read The Hobbit, and background
                                information to set the stage for the novel. The body of the volume consists of Book One:
                                The
                                Ring Sets Out, and Book Two: The Ring Goes South.

                                Prologue
                                The prologue explains that the work is "largely concerned with hobbits", telling of
                                their
                                origins in a migration from the east, their habits such as smoking "pipe-weed", and how
                                their homeland the Shire is organised. It explains how the narrative follows on from The
                                Hobbit, in which the hobbit Bilbo Baggins finds the One Ring, which had been in the
                                possession of Gollum.

                                Book I: The Ring Sets Out

                                Gandalf proves that Frodo's Ring is the One Ring by throwing it into Frodo's fireplace,
                                revealing the hidden text of the Rhyme of the Rings.
                                Bilbo celebrates his eleventy-first (111th) birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly,
                                passing
                                the Ring to Frodo Baggins, his cousin[a] and heir. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's
                                origin, but the wizard Gandalf suspects it is a Ring of Power. Seventeen years later, in
                                "The Shadow of the Past", Gandalf tells Frodo that he has confirmed that the Ring is the
                                one
                                lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago and counsels him to take it away from the Shire.
                                Gandalf leaves, promising to return by Frodo's birthday and accompany him on his
                                journey,
                                but fails to do so.

                                Frodo sets out on foot, offering a cover story of moving to Crickhollow, accompanied by
                                his
                                gardener Sam Gamgee and his cousin Pippin Took. They are pursued by mysterious Black
                                Riders,
                                but meet a passing group of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion, whose chants to Elbereth ward
                                off
                                the Riders. The hobbits spend the night with them, then take an evasive short cut the
                                next
                                day, and arrive at the farm of Farmer Maggot, who takes them to Bucklebury Ferry, where
                                they
                                meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. When they reach the house at Crickhollow, Merry and
                                Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on travelling with Frodo and Sam.

                                They decide to try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest.
                                Merry
                                and Pippin are trapped by Old Man Willow, an ancient tree who controls much of the
                                forest,
                                but are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Leaving the refuge of Tom's house, they get lost in a
                                fog
                                and are caught by a barrow-wight in a barrow on the downs, but Frodo, awakening from the
                                barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them, and equips them with ancient
                                swords from the barrow-wight's hoard.

                                The hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider. The
                                innkeeper gives Frodo a letter from Gandalf written three months before which identifies
                                Strider as a friend. Knowing the riders will attempt to seize the party, Strider guides
                                the
                                hobbits through the wilderness toward the Elven sanctuary of Rivendell. On the way, the
                                group stops at the hill Weathertop. While at Weathertop, they are again attacked by five
                                of
                                the nine Black Riders. During the struggle, their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed
                                blade.
                                After fighting them off, Strider treats Frodo with the herb athelas, and is joined by
                                the
                                Elf Glorfindel who has been searching for the party. Glorfindel rides with Frodo, now
                                deathly ill, toward Rivendell. The Black Riders nearly capture Frodo at the Ford of
                                Bruinen,
                                but upon attempting to cross the ford, flood waters summoned by Elrond rise up and
                                overwhelm
                                them.

                                Book II: The Ring Goes South

                                Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. Gandalf informs Frodo that the Black
                                Riders
                                are the NazgÃ»l, Men from ancient times enslaved by lesser Rings of Power to serve
                                Sauron.
                                The Council of Elrond discusses the history of Sauron and the Ring. Strider is revealed
                                to
                                be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur. Isildur had cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand in the
                                battle ending the Second Age, but refused to destroy it, claiming it for himself. The
                                Ring
                                had been lost when Isildur was killed, finally ending up in Bilbo's possession after his
                                meeting with Gollum, described in The Hobbit. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard,
                                Saruman, has betrayed them and is now working to become a power in his own right.
                                Gandalf
                                was captured by him, but escaped, explaining why he had failed to return to meet Frodo
                                as he
                                had promised.

                                The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed, but that can only be done by
                                sending it
                                to the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon
                                himself.
                                Elrond, with the advice of Gandalf, chooses companions for him. The Fellowship of the
                                Ring
                                consists of nine walkers who set out on the quest to destroy the One Ring, in opposition
                                to
                                the nine Black Riders: Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took;
                                Gandalf;
                                the Elf Legolas; the Dwarf Gimli; and the Men Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of
                                Gondor. The Fellowship thus represents the Free Peoples of the West â Elves, Dwarves,
                                Men,
                                and Hobbits, assisted by a Wizard.

                                After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains over the Redhorn Pass, the
                                Fellowship
                                take the perilous path through the Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin, one of the
                                Dwarves
                                who accompanied Bilbo in The Hobbit, and his colony of Dwarves were killed by Orcs.
                                After
                                surviving an attack, they are pursued by Orcs and a Balrog, an ancient fire demon from a
                                prior Age. Gandalf confronts the Balrog, and both of them fall into the abyss of Moria.
                                The
                                others escape and find refuge in the timeless Elven forest of LothlÃ³rien, where they are
                                counselled by the Lady Galadriel. Before they leave, Galadriel tests their loyalty, and
                                gives them individual, magical gifts to help them on their quest. She allows Frodo and
                                Sam
                                to look into her fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel, to see visions of the past, the
                                present,
                                and perhaps the future, and she refuses to take the Ring Frodo offers her, knowing that
                                it
                                would master her.

                                Galadriel's husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, elven cloaks, and waybread
                                (Lembas), and they travel down the River Anduin to the hill of Amon Hen. There, Boromir
                                tries to take the Ring from Frodo, but immediately regrets it after Frodo puts on the
                                Ring
                                and disappears. Frodo chooses to go alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends,
                                intercepts him as he tries to take a boat across the river, and goes with him.</p>

                            <h2>The Two Towers</h2>
                            <p>The Two Towers is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of
                                the
                                Rings. It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by The Return of the
                                King.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Title and publication</h2>
                            <p>The Lord of the Rings is composed of six "books", aside from an introduction, a prologue
                                and
                                six appendices. However, the novel was originally published as three separate volumes,
                                due
                                to post-World War II paper shortages and size and price considerations.[2] The Two
                                Towers
                                covers Books Three and Four.

                                Tolkien wrote: "The Two Towers gets as near as possible to finding a title to cover the
                                widely divergent Books Three and Four; and can be left ambiguous."[3] At this stage he
                                planned to title the individual books. The proposed title for Book Three was The Treason
                                of
                                Isengard. Book Four was titled The Journey of the Ringbearers or The Ring Goes East. The
                                titles The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East were used in the Millennium
                                edition.
                                In other editions the Books are often untitled.

                                In letters to Rayner Unwin, Tolkien considered naming the two as Orthanc and Barad-dÃ»r,
                                Minas Tirith and Barad-dÃ»r, or Orthanc and the Tower of Cirith Ungol.[3][4] However, a
                                month
                                later, he wrote a note published at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, and later
                                drew a
                                cover illustration, both of which identified the pair as Minas Morgul and Orthanc.[5][6]
                                In
                                the illustration, Orthanc is shown as a black tower, three-horned, with the sign of the
                                White Hand beside it; Minas Morgul is a white tower, with a thin waning moon above it,
                                in
                                reference to its original name, Minas Ithil, the Tower of the Rising Moon. Between the
                                two
                                towers a NazgÃ»l flies.</p>
                            <h2>Contents</h2>
                            <p>Some editions of the volume contain a Synopsis for readers who have not read the earlier
                                volumes. The body of the volume consists of Book Three: The Treason of Isengard, and
                                Book
                                Four: The Ring Goes East.

                                Book III: The Treason of Isengard
                                A party of large Orcs, Uruk-hai, sent by Saruman, and other Orcs sent by Sauron and led
                                by
                                GrishnÃ¡kh, attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the
                                Orcs,
                                but they kill him and capture the two hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to
                                pursue
                                the Orcs taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman. In the kingdom of Rohan, the Orcs are
                                killed by
                                Riders of Rohan, led by Ãomer. Merry and Pippin escape into Fangorn Forest, where they
                                are
                                befriended by Treebeard, the oldest of the tree-like Ents. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas
                                track
                                the hobbits to Fangorn. There they unexpectedly meet Gandalf.

                                Gandalf explains that he killed the Balrog. He was also killed in the fight, but was
                                sent
                                back to Middle-earth to complete his mission. He is clothed in white and is now Gandalf
                                the
                                White, for he has taken Saruman's place as the chief of the wizards. Gandalf assures his
                                friends that Merry and Pippin are safe. Together they ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan.
                                Gandalf frees ThÃ©oden, King of Rohan, from the influence of Saruman's spy GrÃ­ma
                                Wormtongue.
                                ThÃ©oden musters his fighting strength and rides with his men to the ancient fortress of
                                Helm's Deep, while Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard.

                                Meanwhile, the Ents, roused by Merry and Pippin from their peaceful ways, attack and
                                destroy
                                Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of
                                Orthanc.
                                Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to ThÃ©oden's aid. He brings an
                                army of
                                Rohirrim to Helm's Deep, and they defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns,
                                never
                                to be seen again. Gandalf, ThÃ©oden, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, and are
                                surprised
                                to find Merry and Pippin relaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to
                                turn
                                away from evil. When Saruman refuses to listen, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most
                                of
                                his powers. After Saruman leaves, Wormtongue throws down a hard round object to try to
                                kill
                                Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals it in the
                                night. It
                                is revealed to be a palantÃ­r, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, and
                                that Sauron used to ensnare him. Sauron sees Pippin, but misunderstands the
                                circumstances.
                                Gandalf immediately rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with
                                him.

                                Book IV: The Ring Goes East
                                Frodo and Sam, heading for Mordor, struggle through the barren hills and cliffs of the
                                Emyn
                                Muil. They become aware they are being watched and tracked; on a moonlit night they
                                capture
                                Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. Frodo makes Gollum swear to serve him, as
                                Ringbearer, and asks him to guide them to Mordor. Gollum leads them across the Dead
                                Marshes.
                                Sam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, SmÃ©agol, whether to break his promise
                                and
                                steal the Ring.

                                They find that the Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded, so instead they travel
                                south
                                through the land of Ithilien to a secret pass that Gollum knows. On the way, they are
                                captured by rangers led by Faramir, Boromir's brother, and brought to the secret
                                fastness of
                                Henneth AnnÃ»n. Faramir resists the temptation to seize the Ring and, disobeying standing
                                orders to arrest strangers found in Ithilien, releases them.

                                Gollum â who is torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his desire for the Ring â guides
                                the
                                hobbits to the pass, but leads them into the lair of the great spider Shelob in the
                                tunnels
                                of Cirith Ungol. Frodo holds up the gift given to him in LothlÃ³rien: the Phial of
                                Galadriel,
                                which holds the light of EÃ¤rendil's star. The light drives Shelob back. Frodo cuts
                                through a
                                giant web using his sword Sting. Shelob attacks again, and Frodo falls to her venom. Sam
                                picks up Sting and the Phial. He seriously wounds and drives off the monster. Believing
                                Frodo to be dead, Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Orcs find Frodo; Sam
                                overhears them and learns that Frodo is still alive, but is separated from him</p>

                            <h2>The Return of the King</h2>
                            <p>The Return of the King is the third and final volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of
                                the
                                Rings, following The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. It was published in
                                1955.
                                The story begins in the kingdom of Gondor, which is soon to be attacked by the Dark Lord
                                Sauron.</p>

                            <h2>Title and publication</h2>
                            <p>Tolkien conceived of The Lord of the Rings as a single work comprising six "books" plus
                                extensive appendices. In 1953, he proposed titles for the six books to his publisher,
                                Rayner
                                Unwin; Book Five was to be The War of the Ring, while Book Six was to be The End of the
                                Third Age.[2] These titles were eventually used in the (2000) Millennium edition. Rayner
                                Unwin however split the work into three volumes, publishing the fifth and sixth books
                                with
                                the appendices into the final volume with the title The Return of the King. Tolkien felt
                                the
                                chosen title revealed too much of the story, and indicated that he preferred The War of
                                the
                                Ring as a title for the volume.[3]

                                The Return of the King was in the end published as the third and final volume of The
                                Lord of
                                the Rings, on 20 October 1955 in the UK.[4]</p>

                            <h2>Contents</h2>
                            <p>Some editions of the volume contain a synopsis for readers who have not read the earlier
                                volumes. The body of the volume consists of books five and six. Book six has variously
                                been
                                titled The Return of the King (clashing with the title of the third volume) and The End
                                of
                                the Third Age, though in many editions the Books are untitled. The volume ends with a
                                set of
                                appendices and an index, varying in different editions.

                                Book V: The War of the Ring
                                Sauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn
                                Denethor
                                of the attack, while ThÃ©oden musters the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith
                                is
                                besieged; the Lord of the NazgÃ»l uses a battering ram and the power of his Ring to
                                destroy
                                the city's gates. Denethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He burns himself
                                alive
                                on a pyre; Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate.

                                Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of
                                the
                                Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, oathbreakers who are bound by an ancient
                                curse
                                which denies them rest until they fulfil their oath to fight for the King of Gondor.
                                Aragorn
                                unleashes the Army of the Dead on the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. With
                                that
                                threat eliminated, Aragorn uses the Corsairs' ships to transport the men of southern
                                Gondor
                                up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. ThÃ©oden's
                                niece Ãowyn, who joined the army in disguise, kills the Lord of the NazgÃ»l with help
                                from
                                Merry; both are wounded. Together, Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle
                                of
                                the Pelennor Fields, though at great cost; ThÃ©oden is among the dead.

                                Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals Faramir, Ãowyn, and Merry. He leads an army of men
                                from Gondor and Rohan, marching through Ithilien to the Black Gate to distract Sauron
                                from
                                his true danger. At the Battle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.

                                Book VI: The End of the Third Age
                                Meanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor.
                                When they reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer.
                                He
                                claims it for himself and puts it on. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo
                                and
                                bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his
                                footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed,
                                Sauron loses his power forever. All he created collapses, the NazgÃ»l perish, and his
                                armies
                                are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.

                                Aragorn is crowned King of Arnor and Gondor, and weds Arwen, daughter of Elrond. ThÃ©oden
                                is
                                buried and Ãomer is crowned King of Rohan. His sister Ãowyn is engaged to marry Faramir,
                                now
                                Steward of Gondor and Prince of Ithilien. Galadriel, Celeborn, and Gandalf meet and say
                                farewell to Treebeard, and to Aragorn.

                                The four hobbits make their way back to the Shire, only to find that it has been taken
                                over
                                by men directed by "Sharkey" (whom they later discover to be Saruman). The hobbits, led
                                by
                                Merry, raise a rebellion and scour the Shire of Sharkey's evil. GrÃ­ma Wormtongue turns
                                on
                                Saruman and kills him in front of Bag End, Frodo's home. He is killed in turn by hobbit
                                archers. Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses
                                his
                                gifts from Galadriel to help heal the Shire. But Frodo is still wounded in body and
                                spirit,
                                having borne the Ring for so long. A few years later, in the company of Bilbo and
                                Gandalf,
                                Frodo sails from the Grey Havens west over the Sea to the Undying Lands to find peace.

                                Appendices
                                The appendices outline more details of the history, cultures, genealogies, and languages
                                that Tolkien imagined for the peoples of Middle-earth. They provide background details
                                for
                                the narrative, with much detail for Tolkien fans who want to know more about the
                                stories.

                                Appendix A: "Annals of the Kings and Rulers"
                                Provides extensive background to the larger world of Middle-earth, with brief overviews
                                of
                                the events of the first two Ages of the world, and then more detailed histories of the
                                nations of Men in Gondor and Rohan, as well as a history of the royal Dwarvish line of
                                Durin
                                during the Third Age.
                                The embedded "Tale of Aragorn and Arwen" tells how it happened that an immortal elf came
                                to
                                marry a man, as told in the main story, which Arwen's ancestor LÃºthien had done in the
                                First
                                Age, giving up her immortality.
                                Appendix B: "The Tale of Years" (Chronology of the Westlands)
                                It is a timeline of events throughout the series, and ancient events affecting the
                                narrative, and in lesser detail, it gives the stories' context in the fictional
                                chronology
                                of the larger mythology.
                                It also tells that Sam gives his daughter Elanor the fictional Red Book of Westmarch â
                                which
                                contains the autobiographical stories of Bilbo's adventures at the opening of the war,
                                and
                                Frodo's role in the full-on War of the Ring, and serves as Tolkien's source for The
                                Hobbit
                                and The Lord of the Rings (with Tolkien representing himself as a translator, rather
                                than an
                                epic novelist). It says that there was "a tradition" that after handing over the book,
                                Sam
                                crossed west over the sea himself, the last of the ring-bearers; and that some years
                                later,
                                after the deaths of Aragorn and Arwen, Legolas and Gimli also sailed together "over
                                Sea".
                                Appendix C: "Family Trees" (Hobbits)
                                Gives hobbit genealogies â not only for Bilbo and Frodo's Baggins family, but also their
                                relations the Tooks and Brandybucks, which connect them to Pippin and Merry.
                                Appendix D: "Calendars"
                                Describes some of the calendars used by the characters in the story, and explains that
                                the
                                Roman month names in the text are "translations" of the names in the hobbits' calendar.
                                (Tolkien was a linguist, and provided Germanic-sounding names for the hobbit calendar by
                                extrapolating names of German and Old English months forward to what he thought they

                                Appendix E: "Writing and Spelling"
                                Describes dwarvesâ runes and the elvish runes use by the other peoples of Middle-earth;
                                the
                                names of the runes and letters incidentally give a bit of information about dwarvish and
                                elvish languages.

                                names
                                which said he had left in original form (since they had no meaning in hobbits' everyday

                            <h2>Unfinished Tales of NÃºmenor and Middle-earth</h2>
                            <p>Unfinished Tales of NÃºmenor and Middle-earth is a collection of stories and essays by J.
                                R.
                                R. Tolkien that were never completed during his lifetime, but were edited by his son
                                Christopher Tolkien and published in 1980. Many of the tales within are retold in The
                                Silmarillion, albeit in modified forms; the work also contains a summary of the events
                                of
                                The Lord of the Rings told from a less personal perspective</p>
                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>Unlike The Silmarillion, also published posthumously (in 1977), for which the narrative
                                fragments were modified to connect into a consistent and coherent work, the Unfinished
                                Tales
                                are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names changed (the author
                                having
                                had a confusing habit of trying out different names for a character while writing a
                                draft).
                                Thus some of these are incomplete stories, while others are collections of information
                                about
                                Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series of notes explaining inconsistencies
                                and
                                obscure points.

                                As with The Silmarillion, Tolkien's son Christopher edited and published Unfinished
                                Tales
                                before he had finished his study of the materials in his father's archive. Unfinished
                                Tales
                                provides more detailed information about characters, events and places mentioned only
                                briefly in The Lord of the Rings. Versions of such tales, including the origins of
                                Gandalf
                                and the other Istari (Wizards), the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the
                                Gladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan, help expand knowledge about
                                Middle-earth.

                                The commercial success of Unfinished Tales demonstrated that the demand for Tolkien's
                                stories several years after his death was not only still present but growing. Encouraged
                                by
                                the result, Christopher Tolkien embarked upon the more ambitious twelve-volume work
                                entitled
                                The History of Middle-earth which encompasses nearly the entire corpus of his father's
                                writings about Middle-earth.</p>

                            <h2>The Silmarillion</h2>
                            <p>The Silmarillion (Quenya: [silmaËrilliÉn]) is a collection of myths[T 1] and stories in
                                varying styles by the English writer J. R. R. Tolkien. It was edited and published
                                posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 1977, assisted by the fantasy author Guy
                                Gavriel Kay.[T 2] It tells of EÃ¤, a fictional universe that includes the Blessed Realm
                                of
                                Valinor, the once-great region of Beleriand, the sunken island of NÃºmenor, and the
                                continent
                                of Middle-earth, where Tolkien's most popular worksâThe Hobbit and The Lord of the
                                Ringsâare
                                set. After the success of The Hobbit, Tolkien's publisher Stanley Unwin requested a
                                sequel,
                                and Tolkien offered a draft of the writings that would later become The Silmarillion.
                                Unwin
                                rejected this proposal, calling the draft obscure and "too Celtic", so Tolkien began
                                working
                                on a new story that eventually became The Lord of the Rings.

                                The Silmarillion has five parts. The first, AinulindalÃ«, tells in mythic style of the
                                creation of EÃ¤, the "world that is." The second part, Valaquenta, gives a description of
                                the
                                Valar and Maiar, supernatural powers of EÃ¤. The next section, Quenta Silmarillion, which
                                forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during
                                the
                                First Age, including the wars over three jewels, the Silmarils, that gave the book its
                                title. The fourth part, AkallabÃªth, relates the history of the Downfall of NÃºmenor and
                                its
                                people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, Of the Rings of Power and
                                the
                                Third Age, is a brief summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings and those that led
                                to
                                them.

                                The book shows the influence of many sources, including the Finnish epic Kalevala, Greek
                                mythology in the lost island of Atlantis (as NÃºmenor) and the Olympian gods (in the
                                shape of
                                the Valar, though these also resemble the Norse Ãsir).

                                Because J. R. R. Tolkien died leaving his legendarium unedited, Christopher Tolkien
                                selected
                                and edited materials to tell the story from start to end. In a few cases, this meant
                                that he
                                had to devise completely new material, within the tenor of his father's thought, to
                                resolve
                                gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative,[3] particularly Chapter 22, "Of the Ruin of
                                Doriath".[4]

                                The Silmarillion received a generally poor reception on publication. Scholars found the
                                work
                                problematic, not least because the book is a construction, not authorised by Tolkien
                                himself,[5] from the large corpus of documents and drafts also called "The
                                Silmarillion".
                                Scholars have noted that Tolkien intended the work to be a mythology, penned by many
                                hands,
                                and redacted by a fictional editor, whether Ãlfwine or Bilbo Baggins. As such, the
                                scholar
                                Gergely Nagy considers that the fact that the work has indeed been edited actually
                                realises
                                Tolkien's intention.[5]</p>

                            <p>The events described in The Silmarillion, as in J. R. R. Tolkien's other Middle-earth
                                writings, were meant to have taken place at some time in Earth's past.[T 3] In keeping
                                with
                                this idea, The Silmarillion was supposedly translated from Bilbo's three-volume
                                Translations
                                from the Elvish, which he wrote while at Rivendell.[T 4] The book covers the history of
                                the
                                world, Arda, up to the Third Age, in its five sections:</p>

                                IlÃºvatar brought the Ainur together and showed them a theme, from which he bade them

                                while others continued to follow IlÃºvatar, causing discord in the music. This happened
                                three
                                times, with Eru IlÃºvatar successfully overpowering his rebellious subordinate with a new
                                theme each time. IlÃºvatar then stopped the music and showed them a vision of Arda and
                                its
                                peoples. The vision disappeared, and IlÃºvatar offered the Ainur the opportunity to enter
                                into Arda and govern the new world.

                                Many Ainur accepted, taking physical form and becoming bound to that world. The greater
                                Ainur became the Valar, while the lesser Ainur became the Maiar. The Valar attempted to
                                prepare the world for the coming inhabitants (Elves and Men), while Melkor, who wanted
                                Arda
                                for himself, repeatedly destroyed their work; this went on for thousands of years and,
                                through waves of destruction and creation, the world took shape.

                                Valaquenta ("Account of the Valar"[T 6]) describes Melkor, each of the fourteen Valar,
                                and a
                                few of the Maiar. It tells how Melkor seduced many Maiarâincluding those who would
                                eventually become Sauron and the Balrogsâinto his service.

                                Arda in the Years of the Trees
                                Quenta Silmarillion (Quenya: "The History of the Silmarils"[T 6]), the bulk of the book
                                in
                                24 chapters, is a series of interconnected tales set in the First Age that narrate the
                                tragic saga of the three forged jewels, the Silmarils.

                                The Valar attempted to fashion the world for Elves and Men, but Melkor continually
                                destroyed
                                their handiwork. After he destroyed the two lamps, Illuin and Ormal, that illuminated
                                the
                                world, the Valar moved to Aman, a continent to the west of Middle-earth, where they
                                established their home, Valinor. Yavanna created the Two Trees, Telperion and Laurelin,
                                which illuminated Valinor, leaving Middle-earth to darkness and Melkor's wrath. Soon,
                                stars
                                created by Varda began to shine, causing the awakening of the Elves. Knowing the danger
                                the
                                Elves were in, the Valar decided to fight Melkor to keep the Elves safe. After defeating
                                and
                                capturing Melkor, they invited the Elves to live in Aman. This led to the sundering of
                                the
                                Elves; those who accepted and then remained in Aman were the Vanyar; those who went to
                                Aman
                                but returned to Middle-earth were the Noldor; those who refused were the Teleri,
                                including
                                those who became the Sindar, ruled by Thingol and Melian. All the Vanyar and Noldor, and
                                later many of the Teleri, reached Aman.

                                In Aman, Melkor, who had been held captive by the Valar, was released after feigning
                                repentance. FÃ«anor, son of FinwÃ«, King of the Noldor, created the Silmarils, jewels that
                                glowed with the captured light of the Two Trees. Melkor deceived FÃ«anor into believing
                                that
                                his younger half-brother Fingolfin was trying to turn FinwÃ« against him. FÃ«anor drew his
                                sword and threatened Fingolfin; this led the Valar to banish FÃ«anor from the city of
                                Tirion,
                                whereupon he created the fortress Formenos, further to the north. FinwÃ« moved there to
                                live
                                with his favourite son. After many years, FÃ«anor returned at the command of the Valar to
                                attend a festival, where he made peace of a sort with Fingolfin. Meanwhile, Melkor
                                killed
                                the Two Trees with the help of Ungoliant, a dark spider spirit. Melkor escaped to
                                Formenos,
                                killed FinwÃ«, stole the Silmarils, and fled to Middle-earth. He attacked the Elvish
                                kingdom
                                of Doriath, ruled by Thingol and Melian. Melkor was defeated in the first of five
                                battles of
                                Beleriand and barricaded himself in his northern fortress of Angband.

                                FÃ«anor swore an oath of vengeance against Melkor and anyone who withheld the Silmarils
                                from
                                him, even the Valar, and made his seven sons do the same. He persuaded most of the
                                Noldor to
                                pursue Melkor, whom FÃ«anor renamed Morgoth, to Middle-earth. FÃ«anor's sons seized ships
                                from
                                the Teleri, killing many of them, and betrayed others of the Noldor, leaving them to
                                make a
                                perilous passage on foot across the dangerous ice of the Helcaraxe.

                                the
                                map of Middle-earth, marking the part of Beleriand not destroyed at the end of the First
                                Age.
                                Upon arriving in Middle-earth, the Noldor defeated Melkor's army, though FÃ«anor was
                                killed
                                by Balrogs. After a period of peace, Melkor attacked the Noldor but was placed in a
                                tight
                                siege, which held for nearly 400 years.

                                The Noldor built up kingdoms throughout Beleriand. FÃ«anor's firstborn Maedhros wisely
                                chose
                                to live in the east away from the rest of their kin, knowing that they would easily be
                                provoked into war if they lived too close to their kinsmen. Fingolfin and his eldest son
                                Fingon lived in the northwest. Fingolfin's second son Turgon and Turgon's cousin Finrod
                                built hidden kingdoms, after receiving visions from the Vala Ulmo. Finrod hewed cave
                                dwellings which became the realm of Nargothrond, while Turgon discovered a hidden vale
                                surrounded by mountains, and chose that to build the city of Gondolin. Because of the
                                secrecy of the Elvish cities of Beleriand, they were more secure from Melkor's armies.
                                Turgon took great care to keep Gondolin secret, and it was one of the last Elven
                                strongholds
                                to fall.

                                After the destruction of the Trees and the theft of the Silmarils, the Valar created the
                                moon and the sun; they were carried across the sky in ships. At the same time, Men
                                awoke;
                                some later arrived in Beleriand and allied themselves to the Elves. Beren, a Man who
                                survived the latest battle, wandered into Doriath, where he fell in love with the Elf
                                maiden
                                LÃºthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian. Thingol believed no mere Man was worthy of his
                                daughter, and set a seemingly impossible price for her hand: one of the Silmarils.
                                Undaunted, Beren set out, and LÃºthien joined him, though he tried to dissuade her.
                                Sauron, a
                                powerful servant of Melkor, imprisoned Beren, but with LÃºthien's help, he escaped.
                                Together,
                                they entered Melkor's fortress and stole a Silmaril from his crown. Amazed, Thingol
                                accepted
                                Beren, and the first union of Man and Elf occurred, though Beren was soon mortally
                                wounded
                                and LÃºthien died of grief. Though the fates of Man and Elf after death would sunder them
                                forever, she persuaded the Vala Mandos to make an exception for them. He gave Beren back
                                his
                                life and allowed LÃºthien to renounce her immortality and live as a mortal in
                                Middle-earth.
                                Thus, after they died, they would share the same fate.


                                The Destruction of Beleriand as told in Quenta Silmarillion, and the Downfall of NÃºmenor
                                and
                                the Changing of the World, as told in AkallabÃªth
                                The Noldor, emboldened by the couple's feat, attacked Melkor again, with a great army of
                                Elves, Dwarves, and Men. But Melkor had secretly corrupted some of the Men, and the
                                Elvish
                                host was utterly defeated in the Fifth Battle.

                                HÃºrin and Huor were brothers; Huor died in battle, but Melkor captured HÃºrin and cursed
                                him
                                to watch the downfall of his kin. HÃºrin's son, TÃºrin Turambar, was sent to Doriath,
                                leaving
                                his mother and unborn sister behind in his father's kingdom of Dor-lÃ³min (which was
                                overrun
                                by the enemy). TÃºrin achieved many great deeds of valour, the greatest being the defeat
                                of
                                the dragon Glaurung. Despite his heroism, however, TÃºrin fell under the curse of Melkor,
                                which led him to unwittingly murder his friend Beleg and marry and impregnate his sister
                                Nienor NÃ­niel, who had lost her memory through Glaurung's enchantment. Before their
                                child
                                was born, the dragon lifted the enchantment. Nienor took her own life, and TÃºrin threw
                                himself upon his sword.

                                Huor's son, Tuor, became involved in the fate of the hidden kingdom of Gondolin. He
                                married
                                Idril, daughter of Turgon, Lord of Gondolin (the second union between Elves and Men).
                                When
                                Gondolin fell, betrayed by the king's nephew Maeglin, Tuor saved many of its
                                inhabitants.
                                All the Elvish kingdoms in Beleriand fell, and the refugees fled to a haven by the sea
                                created by Tuor. The son of Tuor and Idril Celebrindal, EÃ¤rendil the Half-elven, was
                                betrothed to Elwing, herself descended from Beren and LÃºthien. Elwing brought EÃ¤rendil
                                Beren's Silmaril; the jewel enabled EÃ¤rendil to cross the sea to Aman to seek help from
                                the
                                Valar. They obliged, defeating Melkor and destroying Angband, though most of Beleriand
                                sank
                                into the sea, and expelled Melkor from Arda. This ended the First Age of Middle-earth.
                                The
                                last two Silmarils were seized by FÃ«anor's sons, Maedhros and Maglor. However, because
                                of
                                the evil way the brothers had gained the Silmarils, they were no longer worthy to
                                receive
                                them, and the Silmarils burnt their hands. In anguish, Maedhros killed himself by
                                leaping
                                into a fiery chasm with his Silmaril, while Maglor threw his jewel into the sea and
                                spent
                                the rest of his days wandering along the shores of the world, singing his grief.

                                EÃ¤rendil and Elwing had two children: Elrond and Elros. As descendants of immortal elves
                                and
                                mortal men, they had the choice of lineage: Elrond chose to be an Elf, his brother a
                                Man.
                                Elros became the first king of NÃºmenor, and lived to be 500 years old.

                                AkallabÃªth ("The Downfallen"[T 6]) comprises about 30 pages, and recounts the rise and
                                fall
                                of the island kingdom of NÃºmenor, inhabited by the DÃºnedain. After the defeat of Melkor,
                                the
                                Valar gave the island to the three loyal houses of Men who had aided the Elves in the
                                war
                                against him. Through the favour of the Valar, the DÃºnedain were granted wisdom and power
                                and
                                longer life, beyond that of other Men. Indeed, the isle of NÃºmenor lay closer to Aman
                                than
                                to Middle-earth. The fall of NÃºmenor came about through the influence of the corrupted
                                Maia
                                Sauron, the chief servant of Melkor, who arose during the Second Age and tried to
                                conquer
                                Middle-earth.

                                The NÃºmenÃ³reans moved against Sauron. They were so powerful that Sauron perceived that
                                he
                                could not defeat them by force. He surrendered himself to be taken as a prisoner to
                                NÃºmenor.
                                There he quickly enthralled the king, Ar-PharazÃ´n, urging him to seek the immortality
                                that
                                the Valar had apparently denied him, fanning the envy that many of the NÃºmenÃ³reans had
                                begun
                                to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. The people of NÃºmenor strove to
                                avoid
                                death, but this only weakened them and sped the gradual diminishing of their lifespans.
                                Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar to seize the immortality denied them.
                                Ar-PharazÃ´n raised the mightiest army and fleet NÃºmenor had ever seen, and sailed
                                against
                                Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on
                                IlÃºvatar for help. When Ar-PharazÃ´n landed, IlÃºvatar destroyed his forces and sent a
                                great
                                wave to submerge NÃºmenor, killing all but those NÃºmenÃ³reans who had remained loyal to
                                the
                                Valar. The world was remade, and Aman was removed beyond the Uttermost West so that Men
                                could not sail there to threaten it.

                                Sauron's physical manifestation was destroyed in the ruin of NÃºmenor. As a Maia, his
                                spirit
                                returned to Middle-earth, though he was no longer able to take the fair form he had once
                                had. The loyal NÃºmenÃ³reans reached the shores of Middle-earth. Among these survivors
                                were
                                Elendil, their leader and a descendant of Elros, and his sons Isildur and AnÃ¡rion, who
                                had
                                saved a seedling from NÃºmenor's white tree, the ancestor of that of Gondor. They founded
                                two
                                kingdoms: Arnor in the north and Gondor in the south. Elendil reigned as High King of
                                both
                                kingdoms, but committed the rule of Gondor jointly to Isildur and AnÃ¡rion. The power of
                                the
                                kingdoms in exile was greatly diminished from that of NÃºmenor, "yet very great it seemed
                                to
                                the wild men of Middle-earth".

                                Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age
                                The concluding section of the book, comprising about 20 pages, describes the events that
                                take place in Middle-earth during the Second and Third Ages. In the Second Age, Sauron
                                re-emerged in Middle-earth. The Rings of Power were forged by Elves led by Celebrimbor,
                                but
                                Sauron secretly forged One Ring to control the others. War broke out between the peoples
                                of
                                Middle-earth and Sauron, culminating in the War of the Last Alliance, in which Elves led
                                by
                                Gil-galad and the remaining NÃºmenÃ³reans led by Elendil united to defeat Sauron, bringing
                                the
                                Second Age to an end. The Third Age began with the claiming of the One Ring by Isildur
                                after
                                Sauron's overthrow. Isildur was ambushed by orcs and killed at the Gladden Fields
                                shortly
                                afterwards, and the One Ring was lost in the River Anduin. The section gives a brief
                                overview of the events leading up to and taking place in The Lord of the Rings,
                                including
                                the waning of Gondor, the re-emergence of Sauron, the White Council, Saruman's
                                treachery,
                                and Sauron's final destruction along with the One Ring, which ends the Third Age.

                                The inside title page contains an inscription written in Tengwar. In English it reads
                                "The
                                tales of the First Age when Morgoth dwelt in Middle-earth and the Elves made war upon
                                him
                                for the recovery of the Silmarils to which are appended the downfall of NÃºmenor and the
                                history of the Rings of Power and the Third Age in which these tales come to their
                                end."[6]

                                Inside the back cover is a fold-out map of part of Middle-earth, Beleriand in the First
                                Age.

                            <h2>The History of Middle-earth</h2>
                            <p>The History of Middle-earth is a 12-volume series of books published between 1983 and
                                1996 that
                                collect and analyse much of Tolkien's legendarium, compiled and edited by his son,
                                Christopher
                                Tolkien. The series shows the development over time of Tolkien's conception of
                                Middle-earth as a
                                fictional place with its own peoples, languages, and history, from his earliest notions
                                of a
                                "mythology for England" through to the development of the stories that make up The
                                Silmarillion
                                and The Lord of the Rings. It is not a "history of Middle-earth" in the sense of being a
                                chronicle of events in Middle-earth written from an in-universe perspective; it is
                                instead an
                                out-of-universe history of Tolkien's creative process. In 2000, the twelve volumes were
                                republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes. Non-deluxe editions of the three
                                volumes
                                were published in 2002.[1]</p>
                            <h2>Contents</h2>
                            <p>Some of the content consists of earlier versions of already published works, while other
                                portions
                                are new material. These books are extremely detailed, often analysing a scrap of paper
                                to
                                provide the full evolution of two or even three different versions of a passage that
                                were
                                rewritten over each other. Despite the great amount of material in the twelve volumes,
                                numerous
                                unpublished texts are still known to exist in the Bodleian and Marquette University
                                libraries,
                                and in other papers held by individuals or organizations, such as the Elvish Linguistic
                                Fellowship.

                                The first five books track the early history of The Silmarillion and related texts.
                                Books six to
                                nine discuss the development of The Lord of the Rings; book nine also discusses the
                                NÃºmenor
                                story in the form of The Notion Club Papers. Books ten and eleven focus on material from
                                the
                                Silmarillion that Tolkien worked on after The Lord of the Rings was published, including
                                the
                                Annals of Beleriand and the Annals of Aman. Book twelve discusses the development of the
                                Appendices to The Lord of the Rings and examines assorted writings from the last years
                                of
                                Tolkien's life.

                                Christopher Tolkien, who edited the books, made the decision not to include any material
                                related
                                to The Hobbit in The History of Middle-earth. His reasons for this were that it had not
                                been
                                intended to form part of the mythology, was a children's story, and had originally not
                                been set
                                in Middle-earth; it was revised during the writing of The Lord of the Rings. The History

                                Hobbit was published separately, in two volumes, in 2007 and was edited by John D.

                            <h2>The Hobbit</h2>
                            <p>The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children's fantasy novel by English author J. R.
                                R.
                                Tolkien. It was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the
                                Carnegie
                                Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction.
                                The
                                book is recognized as a classic in children's literature, and is one of the best-selling
                                books of all time with over 100 million copies sold.

                                The Hobbit is set within Tolkien's fictional universe and follows the quest of
                                home-loving
                                Bilbo Baggins, the titular hobbit, to win a share of the treasure guarded by a dragon
                                named
                                Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from his light-hearted, rural surroundings into more
                                sinister territory.

                                The story is told in the form of an episodic quest, and most chapters introduce a
                                specific
                                creature or type of creature of Tolkien's geography. Bilbo gains a new level of
                                maturity,
                                competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous
                                sides
                                of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in
                                the
                                Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters
                                re-emerge to engage in conflict.

                                Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs
                                of
                                warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien's own experiences during World
                                War I
                                as instrumental in shaping the story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic
                                philology
                                and interest in mythology and fairy tales are often noted as influences.

                                The publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and,
                                therefore,
                                requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on its successor, The Lord of the
                                Rings, he
                                made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit. These few but significant
                                changes
                                were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor
                                emendations,
                                including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo
                                stumbled.

                                The work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations
                                for
                                stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have
                                received critical recognition on their own merits.</p>
                            <h2>Plot</h2>
                            <p>Gandalf tricks Bilbo Baggins into hosting a party for Thorin Oakenshield and his band of
                                twelve dwarves (Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur,
                                and
                                Bombur), who sing of reclaiming their ancient home, Lonely Mountain, and its vast
                                treasure
                                from the dragon Smaug. When the music ends, Gandalf unveils ThrÃ³r's map showing a secret
                                door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition's
                                "burglar". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.

                                The group travels into the wild. Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to
                                Rivendell, where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. When they attempt to cross
                                the
                                Misty Mountains, they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Although
                                Gandalf
                                rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the
                                goblin tunnels, he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum, who
                                engages
                                him in a game, each posing a riddle until one of them cannot solve it. If Bilbo wins,
                                Gollum
                                will show him the way out of the tunnels, but if he fails, his life will be forfeit.
                                With
                                the help of the ring, which confers invisibility, Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves,
                                improving his reputation with them. The goblins and Wargs give chase, but the company
                                are
                                saved by eagles. They rest in the house of Beorn.

                                Erebor, and Esgaroth upon the Long Lake
                                The company enters the dark forest of Mirkwood without Gandalf, who has other
                                responsibilities. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then
                                from the dungeons of the Wood-elves. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are
                                welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil
                                prophecies
                                of Smaug's demise. The expedition reaches the mountain and finds the secret door. The
                                dwarves send a reluctant Bilbo inside to scout the dragon's lair. He steals a great cup
                                and,
                                while conversing with Smaug, spots a gap in the ancient dragon's armour. The enraged
                                dragon,
                                deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruders, flies off to destroy the town. A thrush
                                overhears Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and tells Lake-town resident Bard.
                                Smaug
                                wreaks havoc on the town, until Bard fires an arrow into Smaug's hollow spot, killing
                                the
                                dragon.

                                When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, the
                                most-treasured heirloom of Thorin's family, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and
                                Lake-men
                                request compensation for Lake-town's destruction and settlement of old claims on the
                                treasure. When Thorin refuses to give them anything, they besiege the mountain. However,
                                Thorin manages to send a message to his kinfolk in the Iron Hills and reinforces his
                                position. Bilbo slips out and gives the Arkenstone to the besiegers, hoping to head off
                                a
                                war. When they offer the jewel to Thorin in exchange for treasure, Bilbo reveals how
                                they
                                obtained it. Thorin, furious at what he sees as betrayal, banishes Bilbo, and battle
                                seems
                                inevitable when DÃ¡in Ironfoot, Thorin's second cousin, arrives with an army of dwarf
                                warriors.

                                Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves,
                                men
                                and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do
                                they
                                win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with
                                Bilbo
                                before he dies.

                                Bilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or need
                                for
                                more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit roughly a year and a month after he
                                first
                                left. Years later, he writes the story of his adventures.</p>
